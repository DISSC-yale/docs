Finding an environment to work that allows you to run code interactivly important. In general what we are after 
is generically called Read Evaluate Print Loop (REPL), which allos you to interact with a programming language. 
There are many variations of this but for the purpose of this page we will covering using jupyter kernals and touch on using emacs.


# Jupyter kernals

Theare are language agnostic features which make using jupyter based projects easily. Every programming language
needs to have a specific kernal which jupyter notebooks use to interact with a programming language.

# Simple REPL

These basically find a way of copying lines of code into  program or the instance of a programing language running in the terminal. 

## Emacs
