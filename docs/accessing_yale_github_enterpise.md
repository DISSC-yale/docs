# Access to Yale-managed GitHub

There are times where repositories or associated document pages are made accesible to certain Yale identities. To access these
types of sites, you will want to make sure you are logged onto Yale GitHub Enterprise repository. There are 2 requirements to access it:

1. You will need to be granted access to the repository. 
2. You will need to [sign in](https://github.com/enterprises/yale/sso) to your Yale-managed GitHub account (which is created automatically).

You can also sign in to your Yale-managed GitHub account from the usual GitHub login screen by typing `_yale` in the username field, then continuing to the Yale single sign-on provider:

If you are not signed in to the appropriate GitHub account, you will get a 404 error when trying to follow a site or repository.
