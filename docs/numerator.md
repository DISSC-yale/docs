# Numerator

Numerator data are stored on the [Grace cluster](https://docs.ycrc.yale.edu/clusters/grace/).

See the **[documentation site](https://silver-adventure-kgqjzk5.pages.github.io/)** for more details and access instructions.

## Access the Site

The documentation site is hosted from a Yale GitHub Enterprise repository, so you will need to [sign in](https://github.com/enterprises/yale/sso) to your Yale-managed GitHub account (which is created automatically).

You can also sign in to your Yale-managed GitHub account from the usual GitHub login screen by typing `_yale` in the username field, then continuing to the Yale single sign-on provider:

If you are not signed in to the appropriate GitHub account, you will get a 404 error when trying to view the site.

## Access the Data

The documentation site includes [instructions](https://silver-adventure-kgqjzk5.pages.github.io/#access-data) on accessing the Numerator data on the Grace cluster.

You can also access the data through a [Globus collection](https://app.globus.org/file-manager?origin_id=bd63231e-1ee9-4b5a-ada7-652d9d8f8f47), if you want to work with the data in your own system.

Access must be requested for each of these methods separately.
